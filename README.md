# My Fork of Obsidian_to_Anki
Plugin to add flashcards from a text or markdown file to Anki. Run in Obsidian as a plugin, or from the command-line as a python script. Built with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) markdown syntax in mind. Supports user-defined custom syntax for flashcards.

This fork has many changes (see commits), bugfixes and new features. I have also removed functionality which i don't need to make developing this fork easier.
